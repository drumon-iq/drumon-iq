# DRUMON

I'm new to coding in general, got into it for personal interest, might become a job ...
  
- I do, in fact, enjoy spending time on virtual eletronic games, how unusual, anyways, my favorite gaming delightments include 
a very broad spectrum from Minecraft to DS3
- Might post small MincedCraft mods ... who knows?
- Small projects might also pop in my GitHub
- And school?
- Cats
